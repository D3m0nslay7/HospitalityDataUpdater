# HospitalityDataUpdater
Created a data input Interface system, this system was responsible for allowing users to input data, formatting and ensuring no errors where allowed during the input phase.
The reason I created this was because the previous data I received from a third party was of very bad quality, so I wanted to create an interface that would allow me and my co-worker to input data efficently without human errors and formatted correctly.


Creating this allowed us to add 500 data entries, compared to the 30 we had predicited without the program.
